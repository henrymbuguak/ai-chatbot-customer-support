Welcome to the **AI-Powered Chatbot for Customer Support** repository! This project demonstrates how to build a scalable, AI-driven chatbot using **Deepseek's Large Language Model (LLM)** and **Python Flask**. The chatbot is designed to handle customer inquiries, provide real-time responses, and integrate with external APIs for dynamic data retrieval.

This project is perfect for developers, AI enthusiasts, and businesses looking to automate customer support and reduce operational costs.

## **Features**
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Leverages Deepseek's LLM to process and respond to customer inquiries in natural language.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Connects to external APIs (e.g., inventory databases, weather services) to fetch dynamic information.
- **Contextual Conversations**: Maintains session context for personalized and intuitive interactions.
- **24/7 Availability**: Provides instant support without the need for human intervention.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Flask for lightweight and flexible backend development.

## **Use Case: GreenGrocer Foods**
This project is inspired by **GreenGrocer Foods**, a leading online grocery delivery service. Their chatbot:
- Handles **80% of routine inquiries** automatically.
- Saves **$1.3 million annually** in operational costs.
- Provides **24/7 support** without additional hires.
- Improves customer satisfaction with faster response times.

## **Environment Variables**
To securely manage your API keys and other sensitive information:
1. Rename the `.env_copy` file to `.env`.
2. Add your Deepseek API key to the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git.

---

## **How It Works**
1. A customer sends a query (e.g., "Where is my order?") through the frontend interface.
2. The query is sent to the Flask backend via an API endpoint.
3. The Flask backend processes the query and sends it to Deepseek's LLM.
4. Deepseek generates a response (e.g., "Your order is out for delivery and will arrive by 3 PM.").
5. The response is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the customer.
